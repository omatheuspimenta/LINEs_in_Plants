## Introduction

Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are a type of non-LTR retrotransposon belonging to the Retroposineae suborder. They are found in all eukaryotes. Compared to LTR retrotransposons, these elements are underrepresented in plant genomes and are also poorly understood in the wider context of land plants. In this study, we reorganised an RT-based database and developed strategies for searching for and filtering LINEs in 54 plant genomes. Analysis was performed on species from the classes Marchantiopsida, Sphagnopsida, Bryopsida, Polypodiopsida, Pinopsida and Magnoliopsida. We investigated the structure, evolution and abundance of LINEs in these genomes based on the conservation of probable autonomous elements. Two families of elements have dominated plant genomes: L1 and RTE. However, fragments of degenerate I, R2 and Jockey elements were also identified, although in low percentages. Most elements exhibited significant variability in ORF1 (5'), while ORF2 remained conserved within two 'essential' domains (EEP and RT), as well as two variable and non-essential domains (Zf-RVT and RNH). Only those containing a 3' poly-A tail were considered for the annotation of probable autonomous elements. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase sequence revealed two consistent clades: one containing elements of the RTE superfamily and one containing elements of L1. Each of these clades contained subclades.

## Repository
This repository is organized as follows:

### Code
The `code` folder contains all files related to the replication of the methodology:

- [`get_domains.ipynb`](code/get_domains.py): Generates the RAW, soft, and hard annotation regions, along with annotation images.
- [`split_seqs_regions.py`](code/split_seqs_regions.py): Separates the regions of the LINEs domains based on the metadata.
